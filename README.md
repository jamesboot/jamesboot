# :mega: About me

## :alarm_clock: TL;DR
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: implementing ML models in analysis & pipeline automation & spatial transcriptomics neighbourhood analysis (interactVis)!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: NextFlow!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Anything! I'll try and help as best as I can!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn
- âš¡ Fun fact: I went to high school in China! And my profile picture is AI generated (surprise!).

## :page_facing_up: Extended Intro
I am a passionate Bioinformatician at the Genome Centre (Queen Mary University of London), a core facility providing NGS services and analysis to internal and external clients. I learnt to code (R) and the basics of bioinformatics during my PhD, which was focussed on the epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles of Glioblastoma brain tumours. Being predominantly self-taught; I love the continual leanring process of coding and bioinformatics which makes everyday exciting! 

I have experience with many dataset types including: 
- Bulk-RNAseq
- Single-cell-RNAseq
- Spatial transcriptomics
- ChIPseq
- RRBS
- Methylation arrays
- WGS
- Flow cytometry

My services range from support to full analysis pipelines for clients, which may include where appropriate: 
- Quality control
- Filtering
- Normalisation
- Dimensionality reduction
- Clustering
- Exploratory analysis
- Batch correction
- Differential analysis,
- Pathway analysis and more.
