## Extended 
I am a passionate Bioinformatician at the Genome Centre (Queen Mary University of London), a core facility providing NGS services and analysis to internal and external clients. I learnt to code (R) and the basics of bioinformatics during my PhD, which was focussed on the epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles of Glioblastoma brain tumours. Being predominantly self-taught; I love the continual leanring process of coding and bioinformatics which makes everyday exciting! 

I have experience with many dataset types including: 
- Bulk-RNAseq
- Single-cell-RNAseq
- Spatial transcriptomics
- ChIPseq
- RRBS
- Methylation arrays
- WGS
- Flow cytometry

My services range from support to full analysis pipelines for clients, which may include where appropriate: 
- Quality control
- Filtering
- Normalisation
- Dimensionality reduction
- Clustering
- Exploratory analysis
- Batch correction
- Differential analysis,
- Pathway analysis and more.
