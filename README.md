# About me

I am a passionate Bioinformatician at the Genome Centre (Queen Mary University of London), a core facility providing NGS services and analysis to internal and external clients. I learnt to code (R) and the basics of bioinformatics during my PhD, which was focussed on the epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles of Glioblastoma brain tumours. Being predominantly self-taught; I love the continual leanring process of coding and bioinformatics which makes everyday exciting! I have experience with many genomic datasets including: bulk-RNAseq, single-cell-RNAseq, spatial transcriptomics, ChIPseq, RRBS, methylation arrays and WGS... and non-genomic datasets such as flow cytometry. My services range from support to full analysis pipelines for clients, which may include where appropriate: quality control, filtering, normalisation, dimensionality reduction, clustering, exploratory analysis, batch correction, differential analysis, pathway analysis and more.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: implementing ML models in analysis pipelines & pipeline automation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: NextFlow!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Anything! I'll try and help as best as I can!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I went to high school in China!
